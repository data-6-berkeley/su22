    "\n",
    "[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) isn't a programming language – it's a \"markup language\", which means that it is designed to format text to look nice. But like a programming language, Markdown has a set of rules (syntax) that govern how it works. Think of it like a fancy Google Docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the most important rules in Markdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Double asterisks (`**`) are how we make words bold. `My name is **Jordan**` renders to \"My name is **Jordan**.\n",
    "- Underscores (`_`) are how we make words italicized. `How are _you_?` renders to How are _you_?, and `what is **_up_**` renders to what is **_up_**.\n",
    "- Hashtags (`#`, `##`, `###`) are how we create titles/headings. The more hashtags you include, the smaller the title is. The title for this question was generated using `## Question 5 – Markdown`.\n",
    "- Unbulleted and bulleted lists are created the same way they're created in a standard word processor, like Google Docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is important to learn because Jupyter Notebooks are often full of Markdown cells (just like this assignment). In future assignments, we will ask you to write answers to written questions using Markdown, and while the majority of your answers will be in plaintext (i.e. with none of the special characters above), learning Markdown is valuable nonetheless.\n",

    "\n",
    "We'd like to analyze sleep at the population level by computing the **weighted average sleep time** of the US population of 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of taking the simple average of sleep hours 0 through 24 (which would be 12 if we weighted all sleep times equally), we will weight sleep time by the estimated % population for that reported sleep time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign `avg_sleep` to the weighted average daily sleep time of the US population. In other words, you should compute a weighted average of the `Sleep Time` and `% Population (Estimated)` columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: The average sleep time should be between 0 and 24 (the number of hours in a day). Remember to use frequencies and not percentages!\n",
