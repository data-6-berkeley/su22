In this lab we will take a brief detour away from Python and data science libraries to talk about websites and web development. By the end of this lab, you will have created your own public-facing website that you can show off to your friends and family and customize with more information about you, showcase school or personal projects, and more (if you want, of course).

This lab will probably take 2 hours to complete, so buckle in! Course staff are here to help with troubleshooting and any questions you might have.
