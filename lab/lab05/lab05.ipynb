Understanding not only *how* each method works, but also *why* and *when* to use them are the key takeaways from this lab; by the end of it, we will be able to query tables in some pretty cool ways!\n",

Also, if there is a row in a table with no match in the other, there will be no row in the output that represents this row. Let's implement both these situations in practice and see how they work:"
