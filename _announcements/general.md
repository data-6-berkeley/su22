We're excited to be teaching Data 6 this summer, and hope you'll enjoy this class. This website will serve as a 'home base' for the course, and will have all of the materials and assignments you'll need. We recommend bookmarking the website for easy access. Additionally, please make sure you have access to the following course resources:
1. [Data 6 Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/us/courses/22794/discussion/)
2. [Data 6 Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/402405)

If you don't have access to either of these websites, please email <a>jweichert@berkeley.edu</a>.

Finally, please fill out this [welcome survey](https://forms.gle/Lt3kpKHFY2JBTKRc6) before the first day of class so we can get to know a little bit more about you and how we can best support you in the class.

Best, [James](https://data6.org/su22/staff/#instructors) and [Will](https://data6.org/su22/staff/#instructors)
