Congratulations on finishing your week of Data 6! Here are this week’s announcements:

* **Homework 1** and **Survey 1** have been released and will be due on **Friday (7/15) at 11 PM** (we extended the deadline by a day)
    * If you are having issues accessing the homework assignment, post on Ed or come to office hours
* **Office Hours** are on Tuesdays and Thursdays 1-3 PM in Evans 6
    * Office hours are a great opportunity to ask questions about difficult concepts or to get help with assignments
    * You can also post any assignment or conceptual questions on Ed
* James will be holding **Coffee Chats** at [Caffe Strada](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Caff%C3%A8+Strada/@37.869146,-122.254859,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x43f6bea2790d5d28?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjjk-n38en4AhXDKkQIHdpBDk0Q_BJ6BAhqEAU) on Fridays at 9am. These are completely optional but you’re welcome to come if you want to ask conceptual questions about Data 6 or ask any questions about life at Berkeley, the Data Science major, or more!
