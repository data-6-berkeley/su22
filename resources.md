## Python Documentation

Learning a new programming language like Python is a lot like learning a new language: you have to learn vocabulary and learn how to string words together to make sentences that are gramatically and syntactically correct. Just like you might use a dictionary to learn the meaning of new words, programmers use **documentation** to understand what functions and data types do and how they operate. Here are documentation sources that are helpful for understanding the functions and objects we use in Data 6:
* [Data 6 Python Reference Guide]()
  * This has documentation for all of the functions we expect you to know in Data 6. You can use this as your "cheat sheet" while working on assignments. We will also provide a shortened version of the reference guide for the final exam.
* [Data 8 Python Reference]()
* [Official Python Documentation]
* [`datascience` Library Documentation]

## Supplemental Readings

Although there is no specific textbook for this class, we will draw on concepts from a couple of textbooks from similar data science and computer science classes. For most lectures, we will post links to chapters from textbooks covering the topics we will discuss in lecture. These supplemental readings are optional, but you might find it helpful

**We do not expect you to read these textbooks in their entirety** (in fact, most of their material is out of scope for this class).
